I am working as a Post-Doc at [GESIS – the Leibniz Institute for the Social Science](https://www.gesis.org/home) in Cologne in Germany, while also finishing my PhD at the [Dawes Centre for Future Crime](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/jill-dando-institute/research/dawes-centre-future-crime), at the [Department of Security and Crime Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/security-crime-science/) at UCL. My PhD focuses on using data science methods to facilitate our understanding of online fraud and how we might prevent or detect it. At GESIS, I work in the [department for Computational Social Science](https://www.gesis.org/institut/abteilungen/computational-social-science) in the team Digital Society Observatory.

My methodological interests include data science methods, such as Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Topics I am currently interested in are deception or fraud detection (e.g., counterfeits), dark web markets, and biases impacting ML performances.
