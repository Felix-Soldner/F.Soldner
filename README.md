I am a PhD student at University College London at the [Department of Security and Crime Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/security-crime-science/). I have a wide interest in many research areas, which led me to study Psychology, Biomimetics as well as Brain and Cognitive Sciences. Following this, I developed an interest in data science, machine learning, and natural language processing, which I applied in deception detection projects. 

My current research focuses on how data science methods can facilitate the detection and prevention of online fraud (e.g. counterfeit goods, phishing pages).
